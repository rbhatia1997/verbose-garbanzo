## Important Note

- The rating system *does* log the rating/star system after you click on a star. It just doesn't save it on the UI. 
- You *do not* need to rate every movie. You can simply scroll down and click the button. 
- No ratings will appear unless you click the button. 
- The movies will update even if you change a prior rating for a movie. 
- The application will take up to 10 seconds to update for system 2.
